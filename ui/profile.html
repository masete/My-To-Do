            <p>So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century
                typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup
                various fonts for a type specimen book.

                It's difficult to find ypp examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text
                in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book
                of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but
                the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for
                centuries.

                And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring
                classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version
                in use far before the age of Letraset.

                McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his discovery;

                “What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
